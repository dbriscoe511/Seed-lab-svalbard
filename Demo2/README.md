**DEMO 2 ADDITIONS**

In demo 2, the team fully integrated the computer vision, localization, and system integration. 
When booted up, the robot will spin until it detects the blue color of painters tape. Once detected,
the robot will drive to the beginning of the tape and follow the line until the end has been reached.

Each folder in this demo folder contains an arduino script, which are individually commented.
The main.py contains the code that needs to be run to perform a comp vision demo,
the "forwardangularpositioncontroller" contains the code to perform the movement functions needed in the demo
